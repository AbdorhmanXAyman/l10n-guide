accesible to non-English speakers.

Pros and Cons of Translating Program Names
==========================================

+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pros  | The program is shown as a script/pronunciation that the user understands  |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cons  | A user will not find the translated program anywhere on the system.  I.e. |
|       | they will not be able to run the program using its translated name        |

Some tips
=========

* **Use single quotes**. It is quite easy to use single quotes around the
  program to indicate that it has not been translated e.g. "Click on the
  'KFishMonger' icon"
* **Change sentence structure**. This source string "%s: Can't init pipe to
  gdmgreeter" can quite easily be translated as "%s: Can't init pipe to program
  gdmgreeter", note that by adding the word program it adds clarity
* **Use explanatory brackets**. If needed add explanatory brackets after the
  word.  You have two options just stick to one method throughout:

  #. Translated_Program (English_Original)
  #. English_Original (Translate/Transliteration).
